# Progress

## Current Status
The Cimulator project is in a functional state with core features implemented. Based on the codebase analysis, the project has implemented the key components outlined in the implementation plan:

- File loading and include resolution
- Job expansion with the `extends` mechanism
- Workflow and rule evaluation
- Variable expansion
- Pipeline simulation
- Command-line interface

The project is structured as a Python package with a clear modular architecture and has test files for various components.

## What Works

### Core Functionality
- ✅ Loading and parsing GitLab CI YAML files
- ✅ Recursively resolving and merging included YAML files
- ✅ Expanding job definitions using the `extends` mechanism
- ✅ Evaluating workflow rules to determine if a pipeline should run
- ✅ Expanding variables in job definitions
- ✅ Simulating pipeline execution based on configuration

### Command-Line Interface
- ✅ `validate` command for validating GitLab CI configuration
- ✅ `simulate` command for simulating pipeline execution

### Testing
- ✅ Unit tests for key components (loader, job expander, simulation engine)

## What's Left to Build

### Documentation
- ❌ User documentation (usage examples, configuration formats)
- ❌ Developer documentation (architecture, contributing guidelines)
- ❌ API documentation

### Features
- ❌ Detailed validation reporting (beyond basic YAML validation)
- ❌ Visualization of job dependencies and workflow
- ❌ Support for more GitLab CI features (e.g., `include:rules`, `parallel`, etc.)
- ❌ Performance optimizations for large configurations

### Testing
- ❌ More comprehensive test coverage
- ❌ Integration tests with real-world GitLab CI configurations
- ❌ Performance benchmarks

## Recent Improvements

1. **Script parsing bug fix**: Script lines with colons now parsed as strings, not dictionaries
2. **Duplicate job detection**: Track job sources across files with validation warnings
3. **Advanced `!reference` support**: Array flattening, cross-file references, complex scenarios
4. **CLI improvements**: File output with --output option, configurable logging levels
5. **Enhanced validation**: Job dependencies, template job handling, variable expansion fixes

## Known Issues

1. **Limited error handling**: Edge cases in YAML parsing and job expansion
2. **Incomplete GitLab CI support**: Missing some advanced features
3. **Limited validation**: Need more schema and best practices validation
4. **Performance**: Large configurations may have performance issues

## Next Development Priorities

1. **Documentation**: Comprehensive user and developer guides
2. **Enhanced validation**: Schema validation, best practices, duplicate job details
3. **Test coverage**: Edge cases and real-world configurations
4. **Performance optimization**: Large configuration handling
5. **Visualization**: Job dependencies and workflow diagrams
