# Active Context

## Current Focus
The current focus is on improving test coverage and enhancing the functionality of the Cimulator project. We've recently fixed two key issues: the GitLab CI `!reference` tag handling and a test failure in the CLI module.

Previously, we focused on fixing an issue with the YAML parsing functionality, specifically the tool's inability to handle the GitLab CI `!reference` tag, which is used for referencing parts of the YAML document.

## Recent Changes
- Fixed the GitLab CI `!reference` tag handling in the loader.py file by implementing a custom reference resolution mechanism
- Fixed a test failure in test_simulate_cli_with_profile by including global variables in the simulation summary
- Added a new test specifically for the `!reference` tag functionality
- Verified that all tests are now passing
- Modified the CLI module to save the output of validate and simulate commands to files instead of printing to the terminal
  - Added --output/-o option to both commands to specify the output file path
  - Updated tests to verify the new behavior

## Active Decisions
1. **Documentation Structure**: Organizing the memory bank with clear separation of concerns:
   - Project brief: High-level overview
   - Product context: Why the project exists and what problems it solves
   - System patterns: Architecture and design decisions
   - Technical context: Technologies, dependencies, and constraints
   - Active context: Current focus and next steps
   - Progress: Current status and roadmap

2. **Architecture Documentation**: Documenting the modular architecture with clear component responsibilities:
   - Loader Module: For loading and resolving YAML files
   - Job Expander Module: For expanding job definitions
   - Workflow Module: For evaluating workflow rules
   - Variable Expander Module: For expanding variables
   - Configuration Module: For loading simulation configurations
   - Simulation Engine Module: For orchestrating the simulation process
   - CLI Module: For providing the command-line interface

## Current Considerations
1. **YAML Tag Support**: We've implemented support for the GitLab CI `!reference` tag, but there may be other GitLab CI-specific YAML tags that need to be handled.

2. **Code Completeness**: The codebase appears to have implemented most of the core functionality described in the implementation plan, but further analysis is needed to determine if any features are missing.

3. **Testing Coverage**: The project has test files for various components, and we've added a new test for the `!reference` tag functionality. However, more comprehensive test coverage may be needed, especially for edge cases and real-world configurations.

4. **Documentation Needs**: While the memory bank now provides high-level documentation, more detailed documentation may be needed for:
   - Usage examples
   - Configuration file formats
   - Error handling and troubleshooting
   - Contributing guidelines

5. **Feature Completeness**: Need to assess if all planned features from the implementation plan have been implemented.

## Next Steps
1. Test the `!reference` tag implementation with real GitLab CI configuration files
2. Identify and implement support for other GitLab CI-specific YAML tags if needed
3. Enhance error handling for edge cases in YAML parsing and job expansion
4. Improve validation against GitLab CI's schema and best practices
5. Expand test coverage, particularly for edge cases and real-world configurations
6. Optimize performance for large configurations
7. Consider implementing visualization of job dependencies and workflow
8. Add more user-friendly output messages and error handling for file operations
